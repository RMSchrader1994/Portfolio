# Professional Portfolio
 
## Overview
 
### What is this website for?
 
This site expands upon my CV and [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-schrader-076731109/). More importantly, recruiters and other professionals are given the opportunity to experience my coding abilities first hand.   
 
### What does it do?
 
This site presents my professional career, from college to the present, using skills that from Code Institute's 12-week coding boot camp in Dublin, Ireland. The site covers my websites, videos, history, skills, contact info, and CV.
 
### How does it work
 
The site uses both HTML and CSS. The site also uses **Bootstrap** extensively for object structure. The personal timeline of events and skills page both use **JavaScript** for style and usage. GitHub's used to deploy and store all files. The site can be viewed [HERE](https://rmschrader1994.github.io/Portfolio/)
